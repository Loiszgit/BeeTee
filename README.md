Demo application for Bluetooth device scanning using the iOS private framework "BluetoothManager"

##Abstract

Because it is not trivial to use a private iOS framework, I implemented a demo application for the `BluetoothManager.framework` in ≥ iOS 7 and < iOS 9.3.

BeeTee offers two approaches, depending on what you want to try:
* An wrapper class called `MDBluetoothManager`, where you can easily interact with the underlaying `BluetoothManager.framework` without any deeper knowledge about `BluetoothManager.framework`.
* Because all of my implementation is open, you can study the underlaying `BluetoothManager.framework` and how it works - but look out, it is not trivial.

Based on the [AppStore guideline §2.5](https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html) not to use private (undocumented) functions it is not possible to publish apps with the `BluetoothManager.framework` in the AppStore. You may need a valid membership of the [iOS Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/), because it makes sense that this app and framework does not work in the simulator.

## iOS 9.3 Linking Problem
[With Xcode 7.3 Apple removed all private frameworks](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/Introduction.html) from the iOS SDKs, so at the moment it is not working! [Any help on this problem is appreciated](https://github.com/michaeldorner/BeeTee/issues/11)!


##Requirements for this app

* iOS version ≥7 and < 9.3
* iOS compatible device (does not working on the simulator)
* Xcode 5 and greater
* Correctly placed header files (see Preparations)

Except the GUI the app and the framework as well works also fine for iOS 5 and 6. But take care about the path (see next paragraph).

##Preparations

Just to clearify: Of course, since they are just two header files, it does not matter actually where the header files are placed in your project. But if you want to use the `BluetoothManager.framework` in other projects, it makes life easier just to import  the framework with the headers. 

* Find the folder, e.g. by terminal
<pre><code>open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS7.0.sdk/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BluetoothManager.framework</code></pre>
* Extract the [Headers.zip](/Headers.zip) archive and add the extracted folder `Headers` which includes `BluetoothManager.h` and `BluetoothDevice.h` in the directory above.
* Restart Xcode
* Now you will find the `BluetoothManager.framework` in Targets → YourApp → Build Phases → Link Binary With Libraries:

The folder can differ: Please take care about your iOS version!

For iOS 8 or later you can use [a new bash script](/checkheaders.sh). This bash script checks if you have put your files correctly. just run it in the terminal with
`bash path/to/the/bashscript/checkheaders.sh`


##Versions
###2.0
* Wrapper classes `MDBluetoothManager` and `MDBluetoothDevice` introduced 
* Updated to ARC
* Extented GUI

###1.0
* Initial Commit as demo project for `BluetoothManager.framework`, Non-ARC


##The `MDBluetoothManager`
Although all of my code is open source, I wrote a wrapper class which abstracts the `BluetoothManager.framework` for an easy handling.
The wrapper interface of this class is quite tiny:

    @interface MDBluetoothManager : NSObject

    + (MDBluetoothManager *)sharedInstance;
    - (BOOL)bluetoothIsAvailable; // is Bluetooth in general available?
    
    // control Bluetooth
    - (void)turnBluetoothOn; 
    - (BOOL)bluetoothIsPowered;
    - (void)turnBluetoothOff;
    
    // handling scans and its results
    - (void)startScan;
    - (BOOL)isScanning;
    - (void)endScan;
    - (NSArray*)discoveredBluetoothDevices;
    
    // (un)register observers, which listen to MDBluetoothNotifications and implement the MDBluetoothObserverProtocol
    - (void)registerObserver:(id<MDBluetoothObserverProtocol>)observer;
    - (void)unregisterObserver:(id<MDBluetoothObserverProtocol>)observer;
    @end

The protocol `MDBluetoothObserverProtocol` requires an implementation of the method

    - (void)receivedBluetoothNotification:(MDBluetoothNotification)bluetoothNotification;

In that method you can handle the reaction to the Bluetooth notifications.



##The `BluetoothManager.framework`

If you want to dive deeper into `BluetoothManager.framework` this section is interesting for you. 

####Available Notifications
    BluetoothAvailabilityChangedNotification
    BluetoothDiscoveryStateChangedNotification

    BluetoothDeviceDiscoveredNotification
    BluetoothDeviceRemovedNotification
    
    // more methods they are not used in this app
    BluetoothPowerChangedNotification
    BluetoothConnectabilityChangedNotification
    BluetoothDeviceUpdatedNotification

    BluetoothDeviceConnectSuccessNotification
    BluetoothConnectionStatusChangedNotification
    BluetoothDeviceDisconnectSuccessNotification


####Usage

Can be used e.g. 
<pre><code>[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(bluetoothAvailabilityChanged:) name:@"BluetoothAvailabilityChangedNotification" object:nil];</code></pre>
and 
<pre><code>- (void)bluetoothAvailabilityChanged:(NSNotification *)notification { ... }</code></pre>
